# Solaran Project

# What is this game?

- Solaran is a MOBA-like game inspired by League of Legend's ARAM mode.

# Idea Dump

- Minions look like Porygon evolution line and evolve as the match goes on.
- Aesthetic for the game is inspired by the Trisolarans from Three Body Problem.
- The characters fight to unlock things from their exposure to human society.
- The Solarans communicate with light and that's why all their abilities are light based.
- Over time, they learn from human society. It has recently become trendy to decorate themselves with tattoos and hats (again from humanity)
- The Solarans are geometric creatures.
- The music in the game should be eerie (Kinda like the sounds in Arrival)
- We need to design the gameplay to be inherently fun, rather than players only playing to unlock rewards and "progress".
- Part of how characters get stronger is from landing abilities (all skillshots) that "stack", e.g. Grasp from LoL
- Is it funny if players can have custom phrases when they use their ultimate abilities, or achieve certain things in matches? (E.g. pentakill/wipes/first blood)
- Proximity voice chat? This might only work if there are community servers, which is what I currently want.
